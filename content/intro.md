# Vesuvius Panoramas and Point Clouds

On my Christmas vacation I got the chance to go to Mount Vesuvius, the legendary volcano near Napoli. 
My adventuring party and I started to scale the beast at around 10am, and my quest was to take photos and make 3D models. 
Two members of my ascent team are also Napoli football fans, and we needed to be leaving before 2pm to watch the game.

In order to fulfill my quest, I brought along two cameras, the X-T4 and X-T50, and two lenses, the Tamron 17-70 f/2.8 and Tamron 11-20 f/2.8. 
For photogrammetric and panorama purposes, this essentially meant I had 11, 17, 20, and 70mm available as focal lenghts, as long term usage of an inbetween zoom is impractical.

In my planning, I saw the otherworldly looking landscapes at the top, the bare outer cone on the trail up, and the amazing views over the surrounding plain. 
I was unsure of what I would be able to capture and model on the way up, so I needed to be quick to determine my subjects. 
I have been yearning to create a larger scale 3D model, most of the time I only get to create models of small 2x2 meter features. 

## Former Caldera

During the last eruption in 1944, the caldera of Vesuvius changed drastically, the current cone established itself from what is now the northern ridge. 
The hike from the parking to the caldera is 3km, and will allow the angular changes to capture the southern faces of the old section.
