You can explore the point cloud of the southern half of the former caldera in the `Point cloud - Former Caldera` tab on the left. 

## Current caldera

When we made it to the current rim trail, the sights are breath taking. 
I knew the crater was big, but it was bigger than I could have expected, the vertical cliffs traversing hundreds of meters and stratigraphic layers plunging into sedimentary spoils is a beauty rivaled by the Grand Canyon. 
The landscape at the top also seems other worldly with the large igneous crags covered in lichen.

The trek around the rim is an out-and-back along the southern half, with three rest points for espresso and souvenirs. 
On the out portion, my first thought was to capture the entire caldera with the 11mm. 
As this trip was in December, when the sun is lowest in the sky, a very limited section of the crater is lit. 
The lack of light was bad for the 11mm as the exposure is going to be significantly different in the lit and shaded portions of the image, and was not a good first choice.

On the back portion of the trip, I decided I would use the 70mm and capture only the lit portion of the vertical walls of the crater. 
At 70mm I would also need to shoot dozens of photos at each location to collect the entire lit portion, luckily it was a clear sky day, so quick and high quality capture was possible. 
In order to keep up with the football viewing deadline, I skipped the end station espresso to start capturing panoramas of the lit section, shooting over 750 photos to make 30 panoramas and a 211 million point point cloud.
